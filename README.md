### Quick Start Guide:
1. Run "**npm install**" to install all dependencies.
2. Install [**MongoDB**](https://www.mongodb.com/download-center), and start it.
3. Install gulp globally by running "**npm install gulp -g**"
4. Run "**gulp build**" to build the distribution folder, then run"**npm start**" to start the server.



### Quick Tips:

Run "**gulp dev**" for development, which will make/update the build, start the server,  auto-restart the server on modification to scripts (using nodemon), rebuild changed files and refresh active pages on any modification made to client folder (using browser-sync).

Install [**MongoDB Compass**](https://www.mongodb.com/products/compass) to visually view data stored in MongoDB.
