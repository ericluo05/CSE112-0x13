### Quick Start Guide:
1. Run "npm install" to install all dependencies.
2. Install [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/download-center).
3. Install gulp globally by running "npm install gulp -g"
4. Run "gulp build" to build the distribution folder, then run"npm start" to start the server.

### Quick Tips:

Run "gulp dev" for development, which will make/update the build, start the server,  auto-restart the server on modification to scripts (using nodemon), rebuild changed files and refresh active pages on any modification made to client folder (using browser-sync).

Install [MongoDB Compass](https://www.mongodb.com/products/compass) to visually view data stored in MongoDB.
