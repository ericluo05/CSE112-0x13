For local e2e testing use remote sauce lab, you'll need to start the proxy application.
There are bash file that can be executed in the windows/mac folder to start the server for you,
although the 2 weeks trials we have already ended and sauce lab 
never responded to my email about extending it.

To get it working again, simply edit windows/start.bat and mac/start.sh 
and replace the -u (saucelab user account name) and -k (sauce lab key)
with a valid acc and key.
